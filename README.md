I love to learn how things work, so I pursued a bachelor's in engineering, the moment I wrote my first line of code I never went back! I mostly write Javascript (Typescript), Python, and Go. I love working at startups where my impact can be shown quickly, psst! but I also don't mind big tech (ex Reddit).
